ROOT.NET

Introduction
============

ROOT is a general utility for data analysis and contains many features that help with high-speed data processing,
signal/background separation, and, of course, plotting. ROOT is written in C++ and comes with a complete meta-data system.
This utility makes use of that meta-data system to generate a fully typed interface to give access to most of ROOT in the .NET world.
See the documentation page for some simple examples.

All ROOT.NET packages are released on the NuGet web server. To download and access, open up the Visual Studio 2010 NuGet pacakge
dialog in a .NET package, and enter the ROOT version number ("v5.30.01", for example) into the search box. Install what you need!

Only the head was copied over, so all the history beyond the head remains on codeplex.
